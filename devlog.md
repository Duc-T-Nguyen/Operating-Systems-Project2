Session 1: 10-23-2025
- created the repo and started to look at the thread.demo.py after working on it for hw due on friday 
Session 2: 11-12-2025
- started work on the teller.py file and created the teller class 
- taking a break to think about the conditions and how to display them. i already have the ones up to entering the safe and doing the transaction 
- started work again on the teller file to finish up the conditions for entering the safe 
- started work on the customer.py by just initializing the variables. Will have to work on the run function and other sub function tomorrow
- created a function to generate at random the customer transactioin type and amount
Session 3: 11-13-2025
- finished up work on the customerpy to generate a random transaction action and amount and then put it through the process of getting to a teller and preforming the action 
- now that i have created the teller and customer i need to create the actual main function to simulate the bank
- the main.py should just be simply initializing the vars and looping to create both tellers and customers. 
- in the teller and customer they should both pass the shared_resources and the id of the customers and tellers
- had a error where i accidently put in the shared "teller" instead of "Teller"
- decided to change the assign method in customer that I had set up previously to just manually do it 
- intially didn't have a way to assign tellers outside of 0 but I added a available category on the shared and added a append on the teller.py the various tellers and then extract a teller from the array on the customer.py
Session 4: 11-14-2025
- taking a final look at the program and cleaning up example files
- made some changes to the customer.py format 
Session 4: 11-15-2025
- made some formatting changes to follow the project requirements in the Customer.py for leaving bank, getting into line, going to a teller, and leaving the bank
